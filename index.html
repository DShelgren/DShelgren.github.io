    <p1> I'm an old tech person. I've worked on electronics since I was 12 years old.
        My first job was as a video maintenance guy, just cleaning VCRs at 16 years old.<br>
        Then I got certified by Sony and could fix anything with that label.<br> Later I learned how to program and went forward in my working life.
        Eventually working at Hewlett Packard, Apple, Intel, and contract manufacturers.<br> Went from assembler to engineer through certification processes of each company.<br>
        Finally got waylaid by disability and switched to unpaid teaching through the Maker community.<br> Helped start 3 separate groups, that are ok.<br>
        Yeah, I can fix anything from about 1980-2019.<br> Taught myself JTAG, arm, 80c51, and other interfaces.<br>
        Wish I could give back to the retro tech universe, so I'm building a bespoke 8mm-16mm scanner from scratch.
